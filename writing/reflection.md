Please answer the following questions after you have completed the programming lab. Write your answers in complete sentences and provide thoughtful responses.

## Comprehension Questions

1. What is the purpose of breaking a program into functions? How did this help you in completing the lab?

Your Response:

It allow's us to have our code to have separate parted spots that makes it easier to not have so much space used in the main.py while getting the same type of outcome.


2. Describe how you validated user input in your version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Why is input validation important?

Your Response:

I validated the user input by using a 1-3 press and if they didn't press that correct number in that range then the round would just move on to the next round.

3. How did you use comments and docstrings in your code? Give an example of a helpful comment or docstring you wrote.

Your Response:

The use of comments helps me understand what I needed to do and how to help keep my code organized white coding, the most helpful comment was probably the "Keep prompting until user enters a valid choice" since it was a part I got stuck on a little bit.

4. Explain how the computer's move is generated in your program. What Python features did you use to accomplish this?

Your Response:

The computer move is generated by randomly selecting either rock paper or scissors in the program.

5. What was the most challenging part of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program? How did you overcome this challenge?

Your Response:

Most challenging part was probably making sure the input and output functions were during the correct things for the rock paper scissors game.



## Ethical Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain? How does this relate to your responsibilities as a programmer?

Your Response:

It is important to make code easy to understand to read so if you are in a group of other coders, the other people have to know what you did to be able to build off of that code in a project.

2. Consider the use of open source code (like the spaghetti code provided). What are some ethical considerations when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others?

Your Response:

Some ethical considerations, is whether or not its something that someone can you to learn from and build off of in their programing skills.
